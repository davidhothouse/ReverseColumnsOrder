# ReverseColumnsOrder
An InDesign javascript that reverses the order of the affected columns.

Select some or all the cells in the columns, or the whole the table, and run the script to reverse the order of the columns. The script works on a table split across multiple linked text frames.

If some of the cells in the columns are merged, the script will prompt you to unmerge the cells before running the script again.
